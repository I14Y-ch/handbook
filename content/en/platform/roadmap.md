The I14Y Interoperability Platform is being developed on the Confederation’s behalf by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) in collaboration with the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication (FOITT). The project phase runs until the end of 2026. After that, the FSO will take over the operation of I14Y.

During the project phase, the platform’s functionality is continuously expanded. Requests for new features can be submitted to the Interoperability Office. It then prepares the detailed specification, prioritises development requests together with the Steering Committee and the National Data Management Committee (NaDB), and coordinates development and implementation work.

If you discover an opportunity for improvement or a bug on the I14Y Interoperability Platform, the Interoperability Service would appreciate a note. You can submit proposals for new features in the [Feature Requests repository](https://github.com/I14Y-ch/feature-requests/issues) on GitHub or via [email](mailto:i14y@bfs.admin.ch). Please describe the requested functionality as precisely as possible. On GitHub, proposals can also be commented on.

I14Y is developed in a so‑called Agile Release Train (ART). Features are continuously specified, developed and implemented. The roadmap below documents which features are planned for which development period; for details on individual functionalities, please contact the Interoperability Office. Priorities may change, for example if new functionalities are given high priority. The roadmap is updated before the start of each new development period (_Program Increment_, PI). The next stages are described in more detail, while later phases are formulated as more general goals.
