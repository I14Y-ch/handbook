I14Y is moving to the Public Cloud. Using the Public Cloud simplifies numerous technical processes, enabling faster and more flexible development. Additionally, operating costs can be reduced, allowing I14Y to remain attractive in the long term.

This webpage provides updates on the status of the migration work. Planned schedule:

__Monday, 17.11.2025:__ The internet address for the staging environment will be updated. Once the internet directories are updated, the staging environment will be delivered from the Public Cloud.

__From Tuesday, 18.11.2025:__ The staging environment will now run in the Public Cloud and can be tested. Issues should be reported to [i14y@bfs.admin.ch](mailto:i14y@bfs.admin.ch).

__Wednesday, 26.11.2025:__ The read-only mode will be activated for the production environment. The metadata from the previous platform will be synchronized with the new installation. The internet address for the production environment will be updated. Once the internet directories are updated, the staging environment will be delivered from the Public Cloud.

__Thursday, 27.11.2025:__ I14Y will be available again with its usual functionalities -- including the ability to publish metadata.
