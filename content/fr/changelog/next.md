The next release of I14Y is scheduled for the early evening of 23 July 2025. It includes the adjustments and enhancements listed below. I14Y partner organisations with the appropriate access can test the updated software immediately on the [I14Y pre-publication environment](https://input.i14y-a.admin.ch). Please contact the Interoperability Service if you do not yet have access to this environment used for software testing.
 
Please note that the release date may be postponed at short notice in the event of problems. It is possible that individual functions may be removed from the release and only activated at a later date. If you have any questions or problems regarding the release, please contact the Interoperability Service ([i14y@bfs.admin.ch](mailto:i14y@bfs.admin.ch)).

- Which organisations use the I14Y interoperability platform? A new page lists all organisations that publish metadata on I14Y. It also shows the number of descriptions of datasets, APIs and public services published by each organisation, as well as the number of concepts published.
- Since early summer, more complex data structures can be documented on I14Y. Previously, this information was only visible in the internal area. The latest release introduces a graphical representation of recorded data structures on the public website.
- Public services can now be accessed individually via the electronic interface (API). Another endpoint also allows I14Y partner organisations to publish public services on I14Y in a fully or semi-automated manner.
- Bug fixes
